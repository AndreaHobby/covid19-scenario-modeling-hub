methods: We use a discrete time SEIR compartmental model fit to observed cases at the county level and aggregated to the states. County level case time series are augmented with 1 week ahead forecasts from UVA-ensemble model before fitting. The fitting procedure takes into account variable case ascertainment rate informed by CDC seroprevalence surveys, growth of variant prevalence informed by Helix/Outbreak.info and ongoing vaccination rates (all at the state level). Variant B117 is modeled to have 50% transmissibility advantage and 60% increase in risks for hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccine efficacy against infection/disease are assumed to be the same, and acceptance levels are assigned by state using latest estimates from COVIDcast Facebook surveys. Hospitalizations and death outcomes are obtained by using an age-stratified adjustment over three age groups (0-18, 18-65 and 65+) with scaling factors to match the respective ground truths. Uncertainty bounds are obtained by using an experiment design over other model parameters such as infectious/incubation periods, reporting delay and bounds on ascertainment rates.
modeling_NPI: NPI impact and adjustments are done by proxy using the fitted transmissibility. The 0% NPIs are assumed to be equivalent to highest transmissibility observed since May 2020. If the current transmissibility is higher than equivalent of scenario defined 50%/80% NPIs it is assumed that the current NPIs reached lowest levels and are not adjusted. Relaxations are done in a linear fashion from current instance as specified by the scenarios. Further uncertainty in NPI relaxation (additional 20% upper bound) is added to correct for estimation errors.
