team_model_designation: primary
methods: Spatial compartment model using public mobility data. Local parameters (case reporting rates, doubling times, etc) are estimated using data from CSSE, HHS hospitalizations and CDC scenario 5.
modeling_NPI: NPI effects are estimated by comparing recent historical growth rates with expected growth rates in the absence of NPI. The removal of NPIs is modeled as a linear daily decrease in that effect.
compliance_NPI: Not applicable
contact_tracing: Not applicable
testing: Not applicable
vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Vaccine efficacy is taken to be the values prescribed in the scenarios.
vaccine_efficacy_delay: Delay in vaccine efficacy is taken to be the values prescribed in the scenarios.
vaccine_hesitancy: Vaccine hesitancy is calculated on a per state, per ACIP group, per age group basis based on the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html). Based on survey responses, assumptions are made regarding how many respondants will never receive a vaccine and how many respondants will delay being vaccinated as part of their state-level priority group. Each group's hesitancy estimate is then clipped to prevent vacccine coverage from exceding the scanario specified value.
vaccine_immunity_duration: permanent
natural_immunity_duration: permanent
case_fatality_rate: Estimated per age group at multiple admininstrative levels based on historical data and case reporting rates. Constant over time.
infection_fatality_rate: Estimated per age group at multiple admininstrative levels based on historical data and case reporting rates. Constant over time.
asymptomatics: Taken from CDC Pandemic Planning Scenario 5. Mean value of 30%.
age_groups: [0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 74+]
importations: Not applicable
confidence_interval_method: Monte Carlo
calibration: Model parameters and their priors are fit to historical data using a coarse Bayesian surrogate optimization followed by a Nelderâ€“Mead optimization to find the local minima in WIS.
spatial_structure: Modeling is done at the county level in the US. Counties are coupled using mobility data.
