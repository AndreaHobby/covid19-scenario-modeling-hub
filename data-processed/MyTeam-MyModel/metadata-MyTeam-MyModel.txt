methods: (State) A basic AR-type time series model fit using case counts and deaths as features.
  (County) Quantile regr. on county pop., case counts, self-reported symptom data, and doctor's 
  visits.
modeling_NPI: We model school attendance and work separately, and have a separate term for overall community contacts (restaurants, shopping, etc). 
compliance_NPI: No further assumptions beyond those prescribed in scenarios.
contact_tracing: Not explicitely modeled.
testing: Assuming to remain at Dec 2020 levels; estimated separately for each state.
vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Assumed to be half of the VE against clinical disease.
vaccine_efficacy_delay: Not applicable. 
vaccine_hesitancy: No assumption in early months as demand exceeeds supplies; however coverage will be capped at 65% across all priority groups.
vaccine_immunity_duration: 2 years
natural_immunity_duration: 2 years
case_fatality_rate: 0.068
infection Fatality Rate: Not applicable
asymptomatics: 0.3
age_groups: [0-4, 5-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+]
importations: We assumed 10 importations per day per state seeded randomly.
confidence_interval_method: likelihood-based 
calibration: Fitted to the last two months of death, case and mobility data.
spatial_structure: No spatial structure, each state modeled independantly.
team_funding: CDC Center of Excellence, grant number 2546852
data_inputs: JHU CSSE confirmed case counts and deaths

methods_long: "State level - A basic AR-type time series model fit using lagged values of case 
  \ counts and deaths as features. No assumptions are made regarding reopening or governmental\
  \ interventions. The model is jointly fit across all 50 US states, after some time-alignment\
  \ is performed as a preprocessing step to facilitate comparison between states. Heavier\
  \ weight is placed on more recent training data, to account for nonstationarity in the\
  \ underlying process. A lasso penalty is added to induce variable selection and prevent\
  \ overfitting. Quantiles are computed using a residual (Gaussian) bootstrap, separately for\
  \ each location.\
  \ County level - A quantile regression model fit jointly across selected counties using (1) \
  \ case counts, (2) self-reported COVID symptom rates, (3) doctor's visits rates related to \
  \ COVID symptoms, and (4) county population.  Features (1-3) are taken at various lags. \
  \ Furthermore, the slopes of features (1-3) are computed over the preceding month and \
  \ included in the model to provide a sense of the virus's momentum.  Signals (2-3) are \
  \ available as indicators through Delphi COVIDcast (http://covidcast.cmu.edu). Signal (2) \
  \ is administered with the support of Facebook. No assumptions are made regarding reopening \
  \ or governmental interventions."
